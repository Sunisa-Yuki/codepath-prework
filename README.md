## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps

App 1: Instagram
Features:
- Unsend the message
- Turning on the vanish mode
- Drafting the stories, posts, or reels

App 2: Line
Features: 
- Pin or announce the message at the top of the chat
- search the word or characters from past message or search by date
- well organized on the functions like create albums, notes, events, links, files, and settings

App 3: Google Map
- sharing the saved lists with others
- suggesting on what we are looking for such as groceries or dessert

App 4: Shoppee
- Searching the custumer's review easily
- Organising clearly with the category for shopping and sorting
- Easy to apply and look for the coupon

App idea:
I would like to improve the iOS 'Messages' application. Since many IOS users rely on this app for communication, some areas could be enhanced to make it one of the most effective communication platforms. 
Firstly, I would add the features to search for specific words or numbers in a chat and show the corresponding date of the message, as well as jumping directly to that message. 
Secondly, I would improve on the current features that are provided by adding the options to easily find specific dates that are mentioned in the chat. For instance, when I search for a photo that I've sent in the past but I cannot remember the exact date, it also wastes time scrolling through the chat history.  Sometimes, the app freezes or blurs, which forces it to return to the most recent messages. However, I do love the "sent later" feature, which allows me to draft messages late at night and schedule them to be sent early the next morning which is similar to the Outlook platform for scheduling the messages.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I am new with the Xcode and Github, so this take more times than what I expected for exploring and fixing the error of the button connection.
